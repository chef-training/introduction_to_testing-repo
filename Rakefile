Howdy, welcome to the Farm! I heard you were coming. Boy you came just at the 
right moment because we have a cow that has gone got loose. I need you bring 
her in here because her configuration is drifting.

Here grab your first tool 'rspec'. Watch this video on how to use it!

* RSpec Command-Line Tool: https://goo.gl/XczUVD

When you're ready run:

    rake rspec_ready

"""

task :rspec_ready do
  puts """

Well now you know how to use it. It's time you try and use it right here! I bet
you'll be able to find the problems right away - that's because you know how to
find that failing test.

Once you find the failing test I want you to OPEN that file up in your editor 
and then you're going to need to watch these videos. They aren't 
long. Sit back and pour yourself something while you do that.

* RSpec Language   : https://goo.gl/a3ZHAj
* ChefSpec Language: COMING SOON

Armed with that knowledge you should be able to fix the test and help keep this 
farm running like clockwork. 

After you fix the text, when you're ready run:

    rake fixed_test

"""

You know there is another tool you can use to make sure everyone and everything
is looking healthy around this here farm. Its called Test Kitchen and it makes
it really easy to write tests. This time in a simulated environment to give more
accurate results.

Take this tool 'kitchen'. Watch this video on how to use it!

* Test Kitchen Tool: COMING SOON

When you're ready run:

    rake kitchen_ready

"""
end

task :kitchen_ready do

Great now you're ready! Use the kitchen tool to verify the state this cookbook.
You might be surprised with the results.

Open up the test file and give a look over. You'll probably find its similar to
the other test file you were looking at already. That's because they are based
on the same language.

* RSpec Language     : https://goo.gl/a3ZHAj
* ServerSpec Language: COMING SOON

After that test is passing, when you're ready run:

    rake kitchen_tested

Well lookie here! Seems you've got this farm looking a little more respectable
then when you first came here. And fast too!

Now there is one last thing to do before I can call you a cowpoke and give you
more responsibilties. And that is foodcritic! Watch a little about how its done.

Seems your startin' to know your way around this farm. That's good. Now time to
put that foodcritic tool to work. Use it to see how our cookbook holds up

After foodcritic is happy, come back inside and run:

    rake all_finished

Well that was quite a day! I want to thank you for helping me out here. There 
is more work to tackle. But you should take time to celebrate what you've done
