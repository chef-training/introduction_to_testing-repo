# Welcome to Chef-Adventure

You're about to embark on an exciting adventure that will help you grow your Chef skills and your testing skills. This will make the cookbooks you write more reliable
and dependable.

To get started with the adventure:

    git clone https://github.com/chef-training/introduction_to_testing-repo.git
    git checkout adventure

Then once you do, I want you go meet up with Farmer Nathen in that directory. So go ahead and open a command-prompt/terminal window in the downloaded directory and then run the command:

    chef exec rake hello_nathen
